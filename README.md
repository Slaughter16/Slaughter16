## 🔍 About Me

I'm a Networking and Cybersecurity practitioner with a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity and CCNA certification. My passion lies in **network infrastructure**, **system administration**, **IT operations**, and **defensive security** operations. I build hands-on labs using tools like **Proxmox**, **pfSense**, **Security Onion**, **Windows Server 2019**, **Windows 10/11**, **Linux VMs (Kali, Ubuntu, Debian)**, **Pi-hole**, and **Splunk** to simulate real-world environments and continually grow my skills.

Most recently, I completed a full-stack Proxmox homelab featuring VLAN segmentation, OpenVPN remote access, multi-VM network simulation, and layered security controls. I enjoy building, breaking, and hardening systems to continually grow my practical skills in a safe lab environment.

### 🔹 [Active Directory Enterprise Lab](https://github.com/Slaughter16/Active-Directory-Enterprise-Lab)
A full-featured **Active Directory Enterprise Lab** built to simulate real-world corporate IT environments. This lab demonstrates enterprise-level AD concepts, security, automation, and administrative practices.  

> Tools used: Proxmox, pfSense, Windows Server 2019, Windows 10/11 clients, Linux Debian client, Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC), Group Policy Management Console (GPMC), Active Directory Administrative Center (ADAC), Sysinternals Suite, Event Viewer.

**Key Features & Configurations:**  
- ✅**Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** setup such as AD/DHCP/DNS integration with `corp.local` domain  
- ✅ **Organizational Units (OUs)** for Users, Groups, Workstations, and Service Accounts  
- ✅ **Group Policy Objects (GPOs):**  
  - Password and Account Lockout Policies  
  - User Rights Assignment for Role-Based Access Control  
  - Fine-Grained Password Policies (FGPP) for admin vs. standard users  
  - Kiosk/Service Account login restrictions  
- ✅ **Service Accounts & Kiosk Setup** for auto-login, full-screen browser, and restricted local logon.
- ✅ **NTFS & Share Permissions** demonstrating inheritance, explicit permissions, and deny rules.  
- ✅ **File Server Organization:** `Common`, `Project`, `Events`, `Contracts`, `Confidential`  
- ✅ **Testing & Validation:** Password policy enforcement, account lockouts, access control verification . 
- ✅ **Auditing & Monitoring:** Event logs, access validation, GPO enforcements.
  
- **Department-Specific GPOs:**
  - 🔹 **IT Department (OU: LabUsers → IT)**
      - Create a centralized Wallpaper folder
      - Share folder and configure NTFS permissions
      - Apply wallpaper via GPO
      - Disable Control Panel access
   - 🔹 **HR Department (OU: LabUsers → HR)**
      - Folder Redirection for Documents/Desktop
      - Enforce password-protected screensaver
      - Disable USB storage access
      - Set up HR shared folder with proper access
  
**Learning Outcomes:**  
- Enterprise-level AD design and management  
- Implementing strong security standards in AD environments  
- Managing service accounts, kiosk setups, and restricted logins  
- Applying NTFS & share permissions to enforce access control  
- Practical understanding of GPO inheritance, overrides, and fine-grained password policies
